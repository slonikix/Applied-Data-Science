This will already show us the best districts to start a hotel. The Restaurants details can be retrieved using search endpoint. For my project I need only good reated restaurant data (above 8.0), and in search endpoint there is a attribute called Rating, i.e for each Rating foursquare has a defined Raating which will help us to get the desired data.\n\nLink to the dataset is: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/data"
